## ⚠️ Is 'Vibe Coding' Hurting New Developers?

![Alt text for accessibility](/blog1.png)

### 🤖 What is 'Vibe Coding'?

"Vibe coding" uses trendy AI-driven tools like GitHub Copilot, Bolt, Cursor, and Lovable to simplify coding. Sounds great, right? Not always, especially for new developers trying to build real skills.

### 🧠 AI Dependency: A Double-Edged Sword

Using AI for quick solutions seems convenient, but new developers might skip essential coding basics. These tools can become crutches, weakening understanding and leaving critical knowledge gaps.

### 🧩 Losing the Skill to Problem-Solve

Constant AI suggestions = fewer opportunities to develop strong problem-solving muscles. New devs risk becoming passive coders, often unsure how their code even works.

### 😓 Imposter Syndrome: Confidence Killer

When AI writes most of your code, you might wonder, "Did I really build this?" That doubt can grow fast, fueling imposter syndrome and shaking your confidence.

### 🛠️ Reality Check: Coding Beyond AI

Real-world coding isn’t always smooth and snappy. Relying on AI can set up false expectations. Debugging, understanding legacy code, and building from scratch are key skills—AI won’t always save the day.

### 🏗️ Building Strong Foundations

AI is a fantastic **assistant**—but it’s not your **mentor**. Here’s what new devs should do:

* ⚖️ Balance AI usage with manual coding.
* 🧪 Solve problems *without* AI.
* 📚 Dive into docs, syntax, and algorithms yourself.

### 🎯 Final Thoughts

AI tools are powerful, but they can’t replace learning the hard (but valuable) way. Nail your fundamentals. Your future self—and your career—will thank you. 🙌
